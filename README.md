A simple Rails project using [Linker](https://github.com/glaucocustodio/linker) gem with Simple Form, Bootstrap and Haml. See it [live](http://linker-demo.herokuapp.com/).

Inside `app/forms/user_form.rb` is a form created with Linker, you can see a Linker-less version the same form in the file `app/forms/user_under_hood_form.rb`
